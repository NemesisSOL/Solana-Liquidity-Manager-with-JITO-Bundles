Hello, I have build a **fully functionable Self Bundle Program** with which you can create Liquidity Pools via **Raydium** and be the **first buying ( snipe ) transaction within this created Pool**. **1st tx is guaranteed!** Comes with detailed **Guide**.

# All functions:

**Create Raydium Pool & Add Liquidity**, the Script will ask you how much **SOL/USDC** should be added into the Pool and with how much SOL **you want to buy your own token**.

Buy & Sell Token, as already mentioned the script also buys your own token. 
Due to **JITO Bundles** you will get **1st Transaction guaranteed** which means that you will have the **lowest entry price possible**! The Script also has **Take-Profit-Function**, which means that the **Script automatically sells** your tokens at a **desired price**.

**Track** how much is your Liquidity Pool worth in and how much your bought tokens are **worth**. 
You can **set limits** to **remove LP** at a certain level.

**Remove LP**: with one click, you can remove Liquidity pool.

You get the **source code**, so you can check yourself that it is drain free!
